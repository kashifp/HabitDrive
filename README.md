HabitDrive is a platform for people trying to build good habits, break their bad habits, and share their progress along the way.

It features a simple login system, an place to create posts, and the main feed in which users can see other users' posts and their own.
Users have the freedom to post about their habits, talk about life, and respond to other users, and more.
It was made using Node.js with MongoDB Atlas as the database.

I created this platform to exercise my new skills in Node.js and MongoDB I had recently learned. This was also my first web app deployed
on Heroku.
